<p>This winter, KAPS is launching a dating service. You heard right… a dating service. But it’s just for fun. So don’t take it too seriously. Just sign up, and see what happens!</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fill out an application by December 31, 2022.</li>
  <li>Halmonis review applications and create matches.</li>
  <li>We set up match dates before Valentine’s Day.</li>
  <li>Here’s a twist: some matches will be in group dates!</li>
  <li>Bonus: a Halmoni will coach you before you go on your date. And you’ll get to tell them all about it after. (Don’t worry if you don’t speak Korean)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-are-these-halmonis">Who are these Halmonis?</h2>
<p>Our Halmonis live in a very nice Korean senior community in Orange County called Laguna Woods (it’s the next town from Laguna Beach). Many of them had super successful careers after coming to America as immigrants. Most of them are in their 70s-80s. And most of them have been married for over 30-40 years.</p>

<p>They love to chit-chat. They talk about all the latest K-dramas. And they love to talk about why young people don’t get married. They talk to you straight. No bullshit. They are very entertaining to say the least.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Are you serious? <br />
Yes we are starting a real service. It is meant to be fun, and matches are not to be taken too seriously.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will I look desperate if I sign up for this? <br />
Honestly, no one who signs up actually believes they will find their true match here. Instead, all of this should be taken as good fun, and nothing more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is my information safe? <br />
Every person who reads personal information will sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). All applications are deleted after matches are made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this on-going or a one-time event? <br />
This is a one-time event. Pre-registration is open now. An application process will start in October. You get matched before Valentine’s Day 2023.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are you doing this? <br />
Halmonis and Harabugis want to connect with young people in meaningful ways. They want to contribute to your lives. They want a relationship with you. This program allows them to use their relationship experience and knowledge to interact with young people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a fee? <br />
There is no fee. But an optional donation of $20 would be used to take out the whole community of Halmonis and Harabugis to dinner.</p>
