<p>This winter, KAPS is launching a dating service. You heard rightâ€¦ a dating service. But itâ€™s just for fun. So donâ€™t take it too seriously. Just sign up, and see what happens!</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fill out an application by December 31, 2022.</li>
  <li>Halmonis review applications and create matches.</li>
  <li>We set up match dates before Valentineâ€™s Day.</li>
  <li>Hereâ€™s a twist: some matches will be in group dates!</li>
  <li>Bonus: a Halmoni will coach you before you go on your date. And youâ€™ll get to tell them all about it after. (Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t speak Korean)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-are-these-halmonis">Who are these Halmonis?</h2>
<p>Our Halmonis live in a very nice Korean senior community in Orange County called Laguna Woods (itâ€™s the next town from Laguna Beach). Many of them had super successful careers after coming to America as immigrants. Most of them are in their 70s-80s. And most of them have been married for over 30-40 years.</p>

<p>They love to chit-chat. They talk about all the latest K-dramas. And they love to talk about why young people donâ€™t get married. They talk to you straight. No bullshit. They are very entertaining to say the least.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Are you serious? <br />
Yes we are starting a real service. It is meant to be fun, and matches are not to be taken too seriously.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will I look desperate if I sign up for this? <br />
Honestly, no one who signs up actually believes they will find their true match here. Instead, all of this should be taken as good fun, and nothing more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is my information safe? <br />
Every person who reads personal information will sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). All applications are deleted after matches are made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this on-going or a one-time event? <br />
This is a one-time event. Pre-registration is open now. An application process will start in October. You get matched before Valentineâ€™s Day 2023.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are you doing this? <br />
Halmonis and Harabugis want to connect with young people in meaningful ways. They want to contribute to your lives. They want a relationship with you. This program allows them to use their relationship experience and knowledge to interact with young people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a fee? <br />
There is no fee. But an optional donation of $20 would be used to take out the whole community of Halmonis and Harabugis to dinner.</p>
